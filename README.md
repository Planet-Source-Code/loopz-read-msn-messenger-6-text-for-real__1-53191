### Description

Yes, you can see what one of your buddies wrote to you with MSN MESSENGER 6 with this.

So you can remote-control a pc using messenger 6!

This code is basically a packet sniffer which searches the packet data for a given command, for examle "shutdown",

then you can make it do what you want.

This code is based on "Raw Packet Sniffer" by IRBme. For the original submission, goto http://www.1vbstreet.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=46567&lngWId=1

I dont deserve credits for this, cause i didn't change much...but hey, it works!
